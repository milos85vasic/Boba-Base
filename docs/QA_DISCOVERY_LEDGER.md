# QA Discovery-Channel Ledger

**Revision:** 1
**Last modified:** 2026-08-08T21:02:58Z
**Status:** active
**Constitution:** §11.4.238 (automated QA must be the DISCOVERER, not the confirmer — every
defect found outside the automated HelixQA regime is itself a coverage-escape release blocker,
not merely a bug to fix).

## Purpose

Every defect this project closes MUST record **which channel found it**: `automated-helixqa`
(the standing HelixQA regime caught it) or an **out-of-band channel** — `manual-qa`,
`operator-report`, `agent-code-reading`, or `incidental-discovery`. Per §11.4.238(C), every
out-of-band entry MUST carry a **coverage-escape audit**: why the automated regime missed it
(cited to the specific missing/blind check, never "we didn't think of it"), and the new or
strengthened automated check — with its own §11.4.115 RED capturing the escaped defect — that
closes the gap.

Per §11.4.238(E), this project tracks the discovery-channel split over time and drives the
out-of-band share toward zero. **Honest boundary (§11.4.6):** this ledger starts wherever this
project's actual history is — see the retroactive seed entries below, all found via
`agent-code-reading` during the 2026-08-07/2026-08-08 governance audits, exactly the channel this
anchor targets. Full retroactive audit of every historical closure in `docs/Fixed.md` (~62 items)
is NOT attempted here — that is out of proportion for a ledger just being stood up, and would
itself be a §11.4.6 fabrication if backfilled without real investigation per entry. The ledger is
honest about starting now, not claiming a false complete history.

## Schema (per entry)

| Field | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `id` | The workable item id (`BOB-NNN`) if one exists, else a short slug |
| `date` | ISO date the defect was found |
| `channel` | `automated-helixqa` \| `manual-qa` \| `operator-report` \| `agent-code-reading` \| `incidental-discovery` |
| `summary` | One line: what was wrong |
| `escape-audit` | (out-of-band only) which check was missing/blind, cited by name/path |
| `new-check` | (out-of-band only) the new/strengthened check that now catches this class, with its RED-capture evidence |

## Entries

### RD2-22 — `PATCH /schedules/{id}` and `PUT /theme` unauthenticated with a token set

- **id:** RD2-22 (governance-audit item, not yet a `BOB-NNN`)
- **date:** 2026-08-07 (found by the 2026-08-07 governance audit), confirmed still open + fixed
  2026-08-08
- **channel:** `agent-code-reading` — found by direct source inspection (comparing sibling routes'
  `Depends(require_api_token)` presence), not by any test or HelixQA run.
- **escape-audit:** `tests/security/test_hooks_schedules_auth.py`'s `_MUTATING` enumeration
  (the ONLY automated check covering this auth surface) was scoped to exactly 4 routes
  (`POST/DELETE hooks`, `POST/DELETE schedules`) when the original RW-02 fix landed — it was
  never extended when `PATCH /schedules/{id}` and `PUT /theme` were added as separate routes. The
  check existed, ran green, and was simply never told about two of the six routes it should have
  covered — a scope gap, not a broken check (per the ledger's `channel` split, this is the
  "genuinely uncovered" class, not "existed-but-missed").
- **new-check:** `_MUTATING` extended to all 6 routes (`tests/security/test_hooks_schedules_auth.py`),
  RED-captured (confirmed 4/4 new-route assertions failed with `expected 401, got 200` before the
  fix), now GREEN (31/31). See `docs/GOVERNANCE_AUDIT_2026-08-08_ROUND2.md` RD2-22 for the full
  before/after evidence.

### RD2-41a — `scripts/docs_chain.sh` Step 1/3 silently no-op'd on every run

- **id:** RD2-41 (governance-audit item)
- **date:** 2026-08-08
- **channel:** `agent-code-reading` — found by directly invoking `docs_chain.sh` and reading its
  own printed error line, then tracing the hardcoded path in source.
- **escape-audit:** **no automated check existed at all** for "does `docs_chain.sh`'s Step 1
  actually run the real DB export" — the script printed an `ERROR:` line on every failure but
  nothing consumed/asserted on that exit status anywhere in the test suite or pre-build gate; a
  human had to actually run it and read the output. Genuinely uncovered, not a broken check.
- **new-check:** `tests/unit/test_docs_chain_binary_resolution.sh` — real-invocation test
  asserting Step 1 resolves a real binary and reaches the real `validate` call. RED-captured
  (confirmed failing against the pre-fix script: `FAIL: Step 1/3 still reports 'binary not
  found'`), now GREEN.

### RD2-41b — `scripts/pre_build_verification.sh` invariant 17 silently SKIPPED on every run

- **id:** RD2-41 (governance-audit item, same root cause as RD2-41a)
- **date:** 2026-08-08
- **channel:** `agent-code-reading` — found while fixing RD2-41a, by checking for the identical
  bug pattern in this sibling script per the project's own extend-to-all-cases discipline.
- **escape-audit:** this is the sharpest instance in this ledger of "the checker itself was
  blind": invariant 17 IS the pre-build gate's own workable-items DB-integrity check, and it was
  silently SKIPPING (not failing — the script's own `else` branch treats a missing binary as an
  honest skip, not a failure) on every single pre-build run since the path was wrong. A gate whose
  own precondition-check is broken cannot report the truth about the thing it gates — an
  `existed-but-missed` class defect (the check existed, ran, and was blind), the more dangerous of
  the two classes per this ledger's schema.
- **new-check:** `tests/unit/test_pre_build_workable_items_invariant.sh` — real-invocation test
  asserting invariant 17 reaches a real PASS/FAIL verdict instead of silently skipping.
  RED-captured (confirmed failing against the pre-fix script via `git stash`/restore), now GREEN.
  **Residual, still-open finding from this same investigation** (tracked as RD2-41's own note in
  `docs/GOVERNANCE_AUDIT_2026-08-08_ROUND2.md`, not yet closed): a SEPARATE, earlier
  mutation-marker carrier false-positive in the same script aborts the ENTIRE pre-build gate
  before invariant 17 is ever reached in a full run — meaning this fix, while correct, is not yet
  provably exercised end-to-end in production; the ledger records this honestly rather than
  claiming full closure.

### BOB-008 — DB↔MD body drift + missing enumerated unblock choices

- **id:** BOB-008
- **date:** 2026-08-08
- **channel:** `agent-code-reading` — found by running `workable-items diff`/`validate` during a
  routine sync check, not by any standing automated gate (no CI job runs `workable-items diff` on
  a schedule).
- **escape-audit:** no automated check runs `workable-items diff`/`validate` as a standing,
  scheduled, or write-seam-triggered gate — §11.4.106(F)'s commit-seam sync hook (which would
  have caught the DB write in commit `54e313f` landing with no matching `docs/Issues.md` update)
  does not exist in this repo. Genuinely uncovered.
- **new-check:** **closed 2026-08-08.** `scripts/pre_build_verification.sh` invariant 17 extended
  to run `workable-items diff` (DB-vs-Markdown divergence) alongside `validate` (internal DB
  invariants) — it now catches BOTH the §11.4.148(D3) enumerated-choices class AND the DB↔MD
  body-drift class. RED-captured via
  `tests/unit/test_pre_build_workable_items_diff_check.sh`'s §1.1 paired mutation (a deliberately
  desynced `docs/Issues.md` — confirmed FAIL with the diff check absent, confirmed correct
  divergence-specific FAIL, distinguished from the separate pre-existing BOB-009/010 `validate`
  issue so the test does not tautologically reuse an unrelated failure — then GREEN after the
  fix, with a companion assertion that the real synced tree reports no false divergence).

## Discovery-channel split (tracked, per §11.4.238(E))

| Period | automated-helixqa | out-of-band (all channels) | out-of-band % |
|---|---|---|---|
| 2026-08-07 → 2026-08-08 (ledger start) | 0 | 4 (all `agent-code-reading`) | 100% |

**Honest note:** 100% out-of-band is the true, unflattering starting number — every entry above
was found by an agent reading code or running commands by hand, none by HelixQA. This is exactly
the state §11.4.238 exists to change; the target is this percentage trending toward zero as the
`new-check` column above closes each specific gap and as future work is driven through the
HelixQA banks (`challenges/helixqa-banks/`) rather than ad-hoc investigation.
